# SQL-Water-Sanitation-Analysis
SQL project analyzing water and sanitation data across African regions

This project analyzes water supply and sanitation data across African communities using SQL. It was created as part of the Axia Africa Project to assess infrastructure quality, water accessibility, and health impacts.

---
**Objective:**  
To analyze the availability of clean water, functionality of water points, sanitation maintenance costs, and public health impacts using SQL queries.

**Database Used:**  
- Name: axia_africa_project
- Table: water_supply_sanitation
- SQL Platform: MySQL

## Table Columns

To improve readability and SQL accessibility, several columns were renamed. For example:
- `Water Availability (liters per capita per day)` â†’ `water_availability`
- `Number of Functional Water Points` â†’ `functional_water_points`
- `Annual Maintenance Cost (USD)` â†’ `annual_maintenance_cost`
- `Waterborne Diseases Incidence Rate (%)` â†’ `waterborne_disease_incidence_rate`
- ...and more.

## Key SQL Queries & Insights

| Query | Insight |
|-------|--------|
| Average water availability per country | Nigeria had the highest average, Zambia the lowest |
| Communities with non-functional water points | Identified infrastructure gaps |
| Top 5 communities by sanitation maintenance cost | Daar (Tanzania) had the highest |
| Functional vs Non-functional water points by country | Helps target maintenance efforts |
| Communities with high disease incidence (>20%) | Public health risk identification |
| Average distance to water source by region | Evaluates access challenges |
| Communities with both NGO and government support | Tracks external assistance |
| Highest population per country | Useful for targeting high-need areas |
